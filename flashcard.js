// Pseudo Coding
// Create a BasicCard constructor. It should accept front and back arguments.


// Create a ClozeCard constructor. It should accept text and cloze arguments.


// ClozeCard should have a property or method that contains or returns only the cloze-deleted portion of the text.


// ClozeCard should have a property or method that contains or returns only the partial text.


// ClozeCard should have a property or method that contains or returns only the full text.


// ClozeCard should throw or log an error when the cloze deletion does not appear in the input text.


// Use prototypes to attach these methods, wherever possible.


// As your application will not have a front end, your only need to determine an efficient way to store cloze-deleted cards—you don't have to solve the problem of displaying them. You are free to decide how you'd like to implement this. One might represent the above flashcard thus:
